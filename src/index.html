Client-Centric Value Proposition for Deal Structuring
1. Introduction

As a Deal Structuring Lead – Client Advisory, the objective is to design a client-centric value proposition that goes beyond cost savings and demonstrates measurable business impact. For this proposal, we will consider a Fortune 100 Global Bank seeking a value-based pricing model aligned with business outcomes such as customer experience, operational resilience, and digital transformation.

2. Value Beyond Cost Savings

While cost optimization remains essential, true differentiation lies in creating transformational value that accelerates the client’s strategic goals. The proposed model emphasizes:

Operational Resilience: Leveraging intelligent automation and predictive analytics to reduce manual interventions, improve compliance accuracy, and ensure business continuity.

Enhanced Customer Experience: Embedding AI-driven insights into customer operations to deliver faster response times and personalized engagement.

Speed to Market: Streamlining product launches through agile governance frameworks and cross-functional collaboration.

Innovation Enablement: Creating a co-innovation lab where Genpact experts and client teams collaborate to design digital-first solutions that drive long-term business growth.

These outcomes not only create efficiency but also expand revenue potential and customer loyalty, positioning the engagement as a growth partnership rather than a cost-reduction exercise.

3. Alignment with Genpact’s Strategic Frameworks

This proposal aligns directly with Genpact’s Lean Digital and Enterprise Transformation Frameworks, which combine process excellence, data-led insights, and AI-powered solutions to deliver tangible business impact.

Genpact Cora (AI + Automation Platform): Automates routine workflows, improving accuracy and scalability.

Design Thinking Methodology: Ensures every solution is rooted in user empathy and business relevance.

Continuous Learning & Training: Embedding Genpact’s internal training models to build client capability in Agile delivery, data literacy, and digital innovation.

By integrating these frameworks, the engagement transitions from vendor-client to strategic transformation partnership.

4. Outcome-Oriented Partnership and Client Success

The pricing model is based on shared outcomes — rewarding both organizations for achieving measurable business KPIs such as reduced turnaround time, enhanced NPS (Net Promoter Score), and improved digital adoption.

Key partnership enablers include:

Joint Governance Model: Ensuring transparent performance tracking and collaborative decision-making.

Outcome-Based Pricing: Linking revenue recognition to agreed-upon success metrics.

Sustainability Focus: Embedding ESG principles into delivery to align with the client’s corporate responsibility goals.

This structure ensures Genpact’s success is directly tied to the client’s growth, reinforcing long-term trust and mutual accountability.

5. Conclusion

The proposed value proposition delivers a holistic partnership model — one that emphasizes digital innovation, operational agility, and measurable business outcomes. It transcends cost savings to enable transformation, resilience, and client success in an evolving competitive landscape.
